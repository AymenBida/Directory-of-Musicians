# Directory-of-Musicians (HTML CSS Capstone project)

The requirements for this project is to create 3 pages, a main page, a search results page and a details page. I created 5 details pages having different content. This project utilizes Bootstrap classes heavily and custom classes but created in the style of Bootstrap so I can use them again for newer projects.

I used 2 `.scss` files : one for general classes that I can use in any project and one for project specific classes.
